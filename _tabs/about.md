- I’m Dhivakar, and I’m currently working on my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering. During my time in college, I’ve dived into various projects across different fields, which has been an exciting journey.

- I have a strong background in web security, along with solid knowledge in the Spring Framework, microservices, software architectures, databases, and APIs. I’ve participated in bug bounty programs and even conducted some workshops.

- On top of that, I’ve explored RISC-V architecture, assembly language, the Xv6 operating system, and reverse engineering.

### Why I’m Writing This Blog

- I’ve been working in the area of web security, which is a broad domain that exposes you to various technical areas that a typical student might not get to explore practically.

- Some of these areas include web servers, web vulnerabilities, real-time software architectures, the evolution of the internet and browsers, and operating systems.

- Recently, I’ve decided to dive deeper into many of these topics in a more objective way. I want to share my studies and critiques as I go through them, summarizing what I learn along the way.

### What to Expect

- Most of my write-ups focus on constructive criticism, and they’re not meant to hurt anyone. Since these write-ups are summaries of my studies, they might not always make complete sense to the reader.

- If you find that’s the case, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhivakar-s-1b272627a)
  for a more detailed case study. While I aim to explore these topics objectively, keep in mind that my case studies might still have a subjective angle.
