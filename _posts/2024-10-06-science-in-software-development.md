### What is Science?

Science is pursuit of knowledge about the natural and physical world through observation, experimentation, and evidence-based reasoning.

In other words, science differs from philosophy in its special thing - objectivity, Which is no matter who is looking, how is he/she looking, the truth won't change its form. It is not influenced by personal feelings, opinions or preconceived notions.

In Science everything is measured in universal units. Consider in a rocket development: science is applied in various aspects. We measure the amount fuel required for a rocket to reach its destination in outer space **in units** using formulas, allowing us to determine the exact amount without relying on trial and error. This approach is formulated and has a strict framework.

### Asking the right questions,

In typical software development, we get distinct peace of software as a result.
Is science really applied in software development? Or is it seen subjectively? Subjectively in the sense that:

1. Mostly, end users validate the product's outcome, right? But how come a user who has no prior knowledge/expertise in comparing software effectively validate the product? won't he see the software subjectively? If so, how can the product meet every customer's satisfaction, which is the ultimate goal?
2. Do even working professionals have a way to objectively measure an outcome.
3. can we actually measure a software product's success (reliability, security, stability) objectively in terms of a unit that universally measures outcome.

Consider a software is developed:
do or can we really use scientific methods to measure software aspects, like using formulas to maximize our success ?

we have principles, theorems, like **S.O.L.I.D, C.A.P, K.I.S.S** that actually describes best way to develop a software. But principles and theorems are way far from totally being objective.

For example, do we have formulas to measure certain aspects?
Say we use principles like S.O.L.I.D to achieve loose coupling, but how do we measure this loose coupling thing? Is it seen subjectively, or is it possible to have a real formula to objectively measure loose coupling?

We surely do have formulas in software engineering, like those for functional point estimation in agile SDLC. Even so, are these formulas actually used in software production, or are they just in textbooks?

Are these formulas actually valid, like $$ f=ma $$, which holds true for all observable aspects of the macro world? Are present-day developers who might not have gone through "software engineering" aware of these formulas?

Do increasing objectivity in software development actually help produce a more reliable, stable, secure product? Can we use science to increase any aspect on software development?

### The Answer

Well, I don't know the answer to most (but not all) of these questions. However, I want to discover the truth, and I am planning to explore these topics.

I am also willing to share my findings as a write-up, which will be a summary of my study.
